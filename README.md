# Decar-CLI

Caffeine free tests and assertions.

## Installation

You can install Watchful via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):
 
    npm install decaf-cli
    
There is no need to install it globally, the recommended approach is to run it by way of [npm sciprts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts). 
If you do decide to install it globally, however, you may need to prepend [`sudo`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudo), depending on your setup.

If you would like to contribute or would simply like to have a look at the code, you can clone the repository with [Git](https://git-scm.com/)...

    git clone https://github.com/djalbat/decaf-cli.git

...then install the dependencies with npm from within the project's root directory:

    npm install
